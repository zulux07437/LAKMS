# LAKMS
A program of bypasses Windows Activation Product with the KMS.<br><br>

This program is alpha version and very unstable. Please do not use the main computer or important computer.

## What is this ?
Activate Windows with using KMS Emulator locally.<br>
In Windows 8+, Localhost can't be used for KMS Host, So DLL Injection(SppExtComObjHook.dll) is used to deceive Localhost.<br><br>
The KMS Emulator is from CODYQX4 Microsoft Toolkit. Thanks.

## How to use
Start the LAKMS<br>
![LAKMS-Start](https://github.com/zulux07437/LAKMS/blob/main/LAKMS-Image/LAKMS-Start.png)<br>

Click the "Get Info and Check Compatibility."<br>
![LAKMS-GetInfo](https://github.com/zulux07437/LAKMS/blob/main/LAKMS-Image/LAKMS-GetInfo.png)<br>

If that is no problem, Click the "Activate !"<br>
Attention: When you activate, The current activation status will be uninstalled.<br>
(The version used for the screenshot has a few bugs, so Unload the DLL is failing.)<br>
